I built this workshop to help students in their academic writing in French and I offer it regularly at the [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc][Student Learning Commons of Simon Fraser University]]. Many points were inspired by questions and challenges I often encounter when helping students one on one in their academic writing.
